Module 6 challenge

In this module we are looking for correlations between latitude and weather conditions. We will be using weather api to gather weather information about cities and creating scatter plots and linear regressions to determine if a correlation exists.
We will also be looking up our ideal vacation areas and finding the nearest hotels in the cities we are interested in.
